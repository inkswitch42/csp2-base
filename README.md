# Client-side prediction, part 2 (CSP2)
(Forked from Joe Best-Rotheray's project, https://github.com/spectre1989/unity_physics_csp)

This is the base project for the second CSP assignment. In this exercise, you'll add a network layer to the solution for assignment 1. More specifically, you'll need to establish aconnection to the server, send input messages at each tick, and respond to state messages when they arrive.
