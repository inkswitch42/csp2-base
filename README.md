# Client-side prediction and server reconciliation, part 2
(Forked from Joe Best-Rotheray's project, https://github.com/spectre1989/unity_physics_csp)

This is the base project for the second assignment. In this exercise, you'll add a network layer to the solution for assignment 1. More specifically, you'll establish a connection to the server, send inputs at each tick, and respond to state updates. Optionally, you'll implement an authoritive server.
